# Technical Report: Domain Name Suggestion LLM

## 1. Introduction

This report documents the development of a fine-tuned Language Model (LLM) for generating domain name suggestions based on business descriptions. The project focuses on creating a synthetic dataset, developing baseline and improved models, implementing an evaluation framework, and addressing safety considerations.

## 2. Problem Statement

The goal is to build an AI system that can generate relevant domain name suggestions for a given business description. The system should:
1. Generate relevant and creative domain name suggestions
2. Provide confidence scores for each suggestion
3. Handle inappropriate content safely
4. Be evaluated rigorously using both automated and human-in-the-loop methods

## 3. Dataset Creation

### 3.1 Synthetic Data Generation Approach

For this project, we created a synthetic dataset of 1000 samples (800 for training and 200 for evaluation) using a script that generates random business descriptions and corresponding domain suggestions. The business descriptions are composed of:

- Business types (coffee shop, bakery, restaurant, etc.)
- Optional adjectives (organic, premium, deluxe, etc.)
- Optional location descriptors (downtown, riverside, etc.)

Domain suggestions are generated by extracting keywords from the business description and combining them with common domain extensions (.com, .net, .org, etc.).

### 3.2 Data Statistics

- Training samples: 800
- Evaluation samples: 200
- Average suggestions per business description: 3.04
- Total domain suggestions in dataset: 1,000

## 4. Model Development

### 4.1 Baseline Model

Our baseline model uses a pre-trained GPT-2 model fine-tuned on our synthetic dataset. The model is trained to generate domain suggestions based on business descriptions using a simple prompt format:

"Business: [description] -> Domain: [suggestion]"

The model is trained with the Hugging Face Transformers library using the Trainer API with standard hyperparameters.

### 4.2 Improved Model

Due to time constraints, we focused on implementing a robust evaluation framework and API rather than developing an improved model. However, potential improvements could include:

1. Using a larger pre-trained model (e.g., GPT-3 or similar)
2. Implementing a retrieval-augmented generation approach
3. Fine-tuning on real-world domain suggestion data
4. Using reinforcement learning with reward modeling

## 5. Evaluation Framework

### 5.1 LLM-as-a-Judge Implementation

We implemented an evaluation framework using an LLM-as-a-judge approach. The evaluator assesses the relevance of generated domain suggestions by prompting a language model to score them based on:

- Relevance to the business description
- Inclusion of relevant keywords
- Memorability and professionalism

### 5.2 Metrics and Results

We evaluated our synthetic dataset with the following metrics:

- Total suggestions: 608
- Unique domains: 481
- Average confidence: 0.725
- Domain diversity: 0.791
- Average domain length: 15.02 characters

Extension distribution:
- .org: 97
- .net: 121
- .io: 93
- .ai: 101
- .co: 100
- .com: 96

Confidence distribution:
- 0.7-0.8: 126
- <0.7: 275
- 0.8-0.9: 126
- 0.9-1.0: 81

### 5.3 MLflow Experiment Tracking

To enhance our evaluation capabilities, we integrated MLflow for experiment tracking and model management. This provides:

- Comprehensive experiment logging
- Metric tracking and visualization
- Artifact storage for evaluation results
- Model versioning capabilities
- Reproducible experiment runs

The MLflow integration allows us to compare different model versions, track hyperparameter changes, and visualize evaluation metrics over time.

## 6. Safety Considerations

We implemented content filtering to prevent the generation of domain suggestions for inappropriate business descriptions. The system checks for keywords associated with adult content, illegal activities, and other inappropriate topics. When such content is detected, the API returns an empty suggestion list with a "blocked" status.

## 7. API Implementation

We implemented a FastAPI-based REST API for serving domain suggestions. The API has the following endpoints:

- POST /suggest: Main endpoint for generating domain suggestions
- GET /: Root endpoint with API information
- POST /suggest/example: Example endpoint with a sample business description
- POST /suggest/safety_example: Example endpoint demonstrating content filtering

The API accepts JSON requests with a business description and returns JSON responses with domain suggestions, confidence scores, and status information.

## 8. Conclusion

We have successfully implemented a domain suggestion system with a synthetic dataset, baseline model, evaluation framework, and API. While the baseline model is relatively simple, the project demonstrates a complete pipeline for domain suggestion generation with proper evaluation and safety considerations.

Future improvements could focus on:
1. Developing a more sophisticated model
2. Collecting and using real-world training data
3. Implementing more advanced evaluation methods
4. Adding features like domain availability checking
