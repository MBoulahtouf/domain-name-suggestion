# MLflow Integration Summary

## Overview

We've successfully integrated MLflow into the Domain Suggestion LLM project to provide robust experiment tracking and model evaluation capabilities. This enhancement significantly improves our ability to track experiments, compare different model versions, and visualize evaluation metrics.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Experiment Tracking
- Automatic experiment creation and management
- Run-level parameter and metric logging
- Artifact storage for evaluation results
- Reproducible experiment runs with unique IDs

### 2. Enhanced Evaluation Scripts
- `evaluation/enhanced_eval_mlflow.py` - Comprehensive evaluation with MLflow integration
- `evaluation/mlflow_tracking.py` - Dedicated MLflow tracking script
- Automatic metric logging for all evaluation results
- Artifact logging for result files and visualizations

### 3. Visualization and Analysis
- `notebooks/03_mlflow_demo.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook demonstrating MLflow usage
- Automatic generation of distribution charts
- Metric comparison across different runs
- Web-based UI for experiment visualization

### 4. Model Management
- Model versioning capabilities
- Parameter tracking for different experiment configurations
- Integration with existing evaluation framework

## Benefits of MLflow Integration

### Improved Experiment Reproducibility
- All experiments are automatically logged with parameters and metrics
- Artifact storage ensures results can be reproduced
- Run IDs provide traceability for all experiments

### Enhanced Visualization
- Web-based UI for exploring experiment results
- Automatic chart generation for metric comparisons
- Distribution visualizations for key metrics

### Better Model Management
